# Color-Based Gestalt Similarity Analysis of Images (Camouflaged and Non-Camouflaged Objects)

Python prototype project that takes in RGB images (camouflaged and non-camouflaged objects) and will output:

  1 - UMAP and GMM for object(s) detection

  2 - Color Heatmap Generation (w/ K-means clustering) and Object Segmentation

  3 - Histogram Analysis of Color Similarities

  4 - Texture Analysis with <???>
