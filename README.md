# Color-Based Gestalt Similarity Analysis of Images (Camouflaged and Non-Camouflaged Objects)

Python prototype project that takes in RGB images (camouflaged and non-camouflaged objects) and will output:

  1 - Color Heatmap Generation (w/ K-means or GMM clustering) and Object Segmentation

  2 - Histogram Analysis of Color Similarities

  3 - Texture Analysis with <???>

  Leads to a new metric for Measuring Camouflage effectiveness??
